# Interactive-Air-Quality-Map
 The main objective of the project is to implement an interactive map visualization that enables the users to view the pollution data effectively and allows them to interact directly with the map in order to construct their own understandings of the information. The map allows user input to facilitate interaction. The input to the pollution map is in the form of filters. These filters provide the ability to select multiple pollutants and time frames to visualize on the map. The implementation of the project is a web application which displays the interactive map and air pollutant information along with multiple statistics. Geospatial data is used for mapping pollution in each state in the United States.
